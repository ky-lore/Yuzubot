Time is beginning to run out on Yoimiya. Even if you're not a Yoimiya fan, I urge you to consider this seriously, as her unfortunate release situation and how it's been handled so far has bad implications for the future of Genshin Impact and its characters. The real important and damning issues surrounding Yoimiya do not lie with her perceived strength level. They don't have anything to do with her seemingly being outclassed by a 4* unit in Xiangling and arguably Yanfei. The real problem that stems from the Yoimiya situation have entirely to do with how this may set a precedent for future characters.

As many have seen, [Yoimiya's kit is inarguably a mess right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/p5sdus/why_yoimiya_needs_fixing_an_indepth_summary_and/). She suffers from many clashing inconsistencies in her kit, her weapon, her artifact set, and even core issues in gameplay that plague not only her, but her entire class (archers). You should really give that link a thorough read, but to summarize shortly, the major pain points - none of which have to do with damage multipliers:

* Her auto tracking and range is terrible (global archer issue)

* Her strongest attacks are locked behind late animations in her attack string (N3, N5 especially), and they're very hard to execute due to the fact that she needs to dodge a ridiculous amount due to having some of the lowest hp/def/interruption resistance in the entire game

* ICD makes vape/melt comps extremely inconsistent and there is zero reason to use her over Xiangling, Hu Tao, or even Diluc in such comps.

* Mind-bogglingly bad burst and effectively zero AoE

* Thus, her most popular comp is Overload - however, due to the nature of Overload and the bad tracking and slow velocity of arrows, her Overload procs literally make her following shots miss

* Her signature weapon (Pulse) and signature artifact set (Shimenawa) literally conflict with each other and her rotations. Using Q punishes you, as you now have no energy to use the 4pc effect of Shimenawa. Further, using the 4pc effect of Shimenawa makes it difficult to have her Q back for the end of her rotation in many instances.

This is just the tip of the iceberg of the issues concerning Yoimiya. There's something to notice about all of these issues - ALL of them would have been extremely apparent and very easily fixable in a beta test from even remotely competent playtesters. Yoimiya's issue isn't that she's weak - it's that her kit is thoroughly underdesigned, and very evidently undertested.

The upcoming 2.1 release showcase stream is one of the very few remaining chances we have
